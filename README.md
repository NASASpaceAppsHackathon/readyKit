## Background

With the world constantly changing through global warming and other natural phenomenons, we need a platform to allow individuals to prepare for any kind of natural disaster.

Undoubtedly, we still see posters about hurricane preparedness and other emergencies but with technology being widely used in the world, these fail to be as effective as they once might have been.

That is where our solution comes in to play. This web app takes the technological aspect into account when informing the public about the importance of preparing for natural disasters. Whether it be an adult or a young child, any individual can access this platform to learn about the different disasters in an easy-to-understand manner, see the suggested check-list for preparations and then customize it to their own needs! User can make a profile, keep track of their checklists and add in emergency contacts, keeping all important information in one location. Being a web-app, it is easily accessible to anyone in the world, thus informing the public globally about preparing for natural emergencies.

One of the strongest points of this application is the clean interface it offers. Usually, informational websites and content tend to less visually appealing but this app is quite the opposite. Even while spreading information about something that is very serious, it does not scare or bore the user. Colors make the app pop out and are a visual treat for users of all ages, from children to adults. Thus, this app ensure that the content is delivered to the user. The interactive aspect lets the user not only learn about such emergencies but also get involved in making their own checklists and exploring a serious topic in greater depth.
